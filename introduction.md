# Introduction

I'll briefly introduce myself, and then it's off to the curriculum.

## Myself 

Greetings. My name is Riku Järvinen. I work as a Cloud Service Specialist (Azure) in a large (1500+ employees) IT company. I have around 15 years of experience in programming, 5 years in full-time work. I worked previously as a High school and comprehensive school teacher for around 10 years on-and-off, as well as an entrepreneur in the educational sector.

My educational background is in science. I hold an M.Sc. in theoretical physics from University of Jyväskylä, and I've also completed M.Sc. level studies in math while my minor subjects include mathematical computer science and education. I hold 
a couple of Azure certifications (Solutions Architect Expert, Administrator Associate) as well as the Terraform Associate certification. 

If you are keen on learning the ins and outs of Wordpress, I sincerely hope you find this content useful. Happy studying!
    
## Goal of this curriculum 

Here is presented an outline to learn Wordpress, and if followed diligently, the learner shall likely become a proficient WP user and a beginner WP developer in around 3 months of time. And also able to learn more advanced WordPress topics later.
    
The target audience for this curriculum is a person with higher level educational degree, e.g. university, but with no previous technical or IT experience. Interest in learning the IT field is a fundamental prerequisite. Another prerequisite is basic computer and internet skills, such as how to find information online and utilise it in useful manner, or how to create a user account to use a web-based service (e.g. WordPress site hosting).
	 
A brief note on the nomenclature. I will use the general term "thing" to describe a concept, a functional whole, a way of working, a convention, or a similar entity that is related to the tech field. The abbreviation "WP" or "wp" is used to describe WordPress in the later parts of this curriculum.

> Note. This project is not associated with wordpress.com, wordpress.org, wordpress.tv or other official wordpress entities. 
> Hence the abbreviation "wp", as recommended to be used on site wordpress.org. 
> 
> Nevertheless, this content is available for anyone interested. I do welcome contributions to this repository and forking the repo is also an option, if you are creating a wp curriculum and wish to re-organize the content a lot.  

## Learning targets 
    
### What is meant by a **Proficient WP user**`? Let's list some key details 

can edit a wordpress site 

TODO
    
### What is meant by a **Beginner WP developer**?

TODO

The developer can: 

- utilise wp-cli command line for basic tasks
  - **TODO** examples of tasks (e.g. backup)
- edit basic HTML and CSS
- create a simple plugin for WP with JS language
  - TODO example
- learn new developer things that require basic developer level understanding

The developer (probably) cannot
- utilise wp-cli command line for advanced tasks
  - TODO example
- create complex plugins requiring advanced JS / PHP,
- performa magical CSS layout hacks
  - e.g. hack CSS with negative margins to "trick" an image to be aligned optically with border X
  - TODO more content here
- Git version control "mastery"
- Do custom installations of wordpress to a given server
- Offer WordPress as a service to potential clients
    
## # Benefits of starting one's web development career with Wordpress

With WordPress, you learn through a visual approach. In IT, this is termed as "what you see is what you get" (WYSISYG). While most of the time learning wp is not code-based development work, on your way you do likely learn 

- general web related concepts, such as hosting, server, eCommerce, back-end, front-end, developer, database 
- IT personnel roles and whatnot, such as administrator, developer, tester, user, community, open source
- development work and workflow related concepts, such as a requirement, convention, best practice, principle of least privilege, consistency, design pattern
- a boatload of abbreviations, e.g. IDE, CLI, CDN, REST, API, CRUD, AJAX,
- general development work related concepts and abbreviations, such as layout, visualization, accessibility,, service (paid / free), function, action, hook, server, file system, code base, client, server, editor,  nginx, Apache,
- Programmning and markup languages of the web, e.g. HTML, CSS, JSON, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
- different types of development work, such as refactor, debug, version, support, program, monitor, operate, review, integrate, publish, install, update, troubleshoot
- environments, such as development staging, production
- important user considerations, such as internationalisation, localisation, accessibility
- development work related abstract concepts, such as plugin, theme, template, pattern, default, preset         
- areas of focus in developing a web based product, such as design, (dynamic) content, notifications, automation, analytics, performance, integrations, search engine optimisation.

Also, In my experience it is worthwile to understand that in tech, a lot of details on a given matter are usually present, and the **skill to differentiate between close to very similar things is essential**. It is IMHO required to develop such skills while working in the industry.

## Learning Approach and Phases of the Curriculum
    
A well-known learning taxonomy was developed by Benjamin Bloom that (in it's 1999 revised form) identifies six objectives for learning: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create. In essence, one could say that using a mimicking learning approach to master a given work task in comparison to creating it from scratch takes considerably less time and effort.

This curriculum introduces four (4) phases of learning, as follows: 
    
- [Phase I: Get to know Wordpress](phaseI/content.md)
- [Phase II: Essentials of WP in practice](phaseII/content.md)
- [Phase III: Core WP skills](phaseIII/content.md)
- [Phase IV: Expanding WP proficiency](phaseIV/content.md)

Let's go over the phases and their content by taking a high-level view. 

### Phase I: Get to know Wordpress

The first phase is targeted at anyone who wishes to get an overview look on wp, with small hands on testing on the side. This phase is mostly about remembering and understanding information, with small practical tasks to get to know wp essentials as accompaniment. Phase I contains 

- Set up WordPress with free trial hosting
- Sign up to Skilljet Academy and take a crash course on wp works (wp101) 

- Theory section: read and watch videos on Wordpress 
- **TODO **  
- Quiz at the end of Phase I

Phase I tries to answer questions such as 

Using wordpress: who uses wordpress?, what can wp be used for?

Developing wordpress: what can be developed? why/how are things developed?    

Time duration: 5 business days
Time off: 2 days (weekend) 
    
### Phase II: Essentials of WP in practice

Create a simple wp site for an imaginary customer. Get to know more of the essentials in practice. Utilise free WP themes and plugins

### Phase IV: Expanding WP proficiency

create a third site, or extend the second with more advanced structures

select AT LEAST three of the modules, study time is 1 week per module
create a WP plugin

  payment handling

  time allocation: 3 to 4 weeks
