# Introduction

I'll briefly introduce myself, and then it's off to the curriculum.

## Myself 

Greetings. My name is Riku Järvinen. I work as a Cloud Service Specialist (Azure) in a large (1500+ employees) IT company. I have around 15 years of experience in programming, 5 years in full-time work. I worked previously as a High school and comprehensive school teacher for around 10 years on-and-off, as well as an entrepreneur in the educational sector.

My educational background is in science. I hold an M.Sc. in theoretical physics from University of Jyväskylä, and I've also completed M.Sc. level studies in math while my minor subjects include mathematical computer science and education. I hold 
a couple of Azure certifications (Solutions Architect Expert, Administrator Associate) as well as the Terraform Associate certification. 

If you are keen on learning the ins and outs of Wordpress, I sincerely hope you find this content useful. Happy studying!
    
## Goal of this curriculum 

Here is presented an outline to learn Wordpress, and if followed diligently, the learner shall likely become a proficient WP user and a beginner WP developer in around 3 months of time. And also able to learn more advanced WordPress topics later.
    
The target audience for this curriculum is a person with higher level educational degree, e.g. university, but with no previous technical or IT experience. Interest in learning the IT field is a fundamental prerequisite. Another prerequisite is basic computer and internet skills, such as how to find information online and utilise it in useful manner, or how to create a user account to use a web-based service (e.g. WordPress site hosting).
	 
A brief note on the nomenclature. I will use the general term "thing" to describe a concept, a functional whole, a way of working, a convention, or a similar entity that is related to the tech field. The abbreviation "WP" or "wp" is used to describe WordPress in the later parts of this curriculum.

> IMPORTANT. This project is not associated with wordpress.com, wordpress.org, wordpress.tv or other official wordpress entities. 
> Hence the abbreviation "wp", as recommended to be used on site wordpress.org. 
> 
> Nevertheless, this content is available for anyone interested. I do welcome contributions to this repository and forking the repo is also an option, if you are creating a wp curriculum and wish to re-organize the content a lot.
