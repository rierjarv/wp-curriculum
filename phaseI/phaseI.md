> Time duration: 1 week i.e. 5 business days
> Time off: 2 days i.e. weekend

**TODO TOC**

**TODO: structure the module as such that practical doing and theory are interrelated**

## Getting introduced to WordPress

> NOTE. This section contains reading and watching videos. If you prefer to get hands on right away, go to section [Set up WordPress with free trial hosting](#set-up-wordpress-with-free-trial-hosting)

What is WordPress? Start by exploring the following content.

## Set up WordPress with free trial hosting 

The service (https://www.namecheap.com/wordpress/)[Namecheap] has been around for quite some time and offers a free trial of 30 days wp hosting. 

Create a namecheap account and choose whatever settings for the wp site. Below, you'll see an example wp site view in namecheap: 

![WordPress on Namecheap](images/namecheap_wp_site_overview_20230313.png)

After the setup, log in to *wpadmin* by clicking the right corner in the previous view and you should now have a site that looks similar to the one below: 

![WordPress on Namecheap](images/namecheap_wp_site_20230313.png)

> Note. While creating the Namecheap account, you need to set up a payment method. e.g. paypal or credit card. In case you cannot perform this step, utilise another free wp hosting provider.

## Register Skilljet Academy free account 

## WP crash course: SkillJet WP101 

After registering to the SkillJet Academy, enroll into the free course "WP101". Go through the videos and during watching, take small breaks to experiment with the WordPress features on the namecheap site created in the beginning of this phase.
