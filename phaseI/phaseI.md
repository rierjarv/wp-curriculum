## Set up WordPress with free trial hosting 

The service (https://www.namecheap.com/wordpress/)[Namecheap] has been around for quite some time and offers a free trial of 30 days wp hosting. 

Create a namecheap account and choose whatever settings for the wp site. Below, you'll see an example wp site view in namecheap:

After the setup, log in to *wpadmin* by clicking the right corner in the previous view and you should now have a site that looks similar to the one below:

> Note. While creating the Namecheap account, you need to set up a payment method. e.g. paypal or credit card. In case you cannot perform this step, utilise another free wp hosting provider.
