## Set up WordPress with free trial hosting 

[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/wordpress/) has been around for quite some time and offers a free trial of 30 days of wp hosting. 

Create a Namecheap account and choose whatever settings you like for the wp site. Below, you'll see an example wp site view in Namecheap: 

![WordPress on Namecheap](phaseI_images/namecheap_wp_site_overview_20230313.png)

After the setup, log in to *wpadmin* by clicking the right corner in the previous view and you should now have a site that looks similar to the one below: 

![WordPress on Namecheap](phaseI_images/namecheap_wp_site_20230313.png)

> Note. While creating the Namecheap account, you need to set up a payment method. e.g. paypal or credit card. In case you cannot perform this step, utilise another free wp hosting provider.

## Register Skilljet Academy free account 

SkillJet Academy offers a free course on WordPress, the WP101. [Create a SkillJet Academy account](https://skilljet.io/login/) (it's free) and check out what they offer. 

## Complete the WP crash course: SkillJet WP101 

After registering to the SkillJet Academy, enroll into the free course "WP101". Go through the videos and during watching, take small breaks to experiment with the WordPress features on the namecheap site created in the beginning of this phase.

> Note. You are not expected to know how to apply everything that is taught after the course, this is just for starters and to show what's up
